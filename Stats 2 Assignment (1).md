Problem Statement 1:


In each of the following situations, state whether it is a correctly stated hypothesis
testing problem and why?
1. 𝐻0: 𝜇 = 25, 𝐻1: 𝜇 ≠ 25
2. 𝐻0: 𝜎 > 10, 𝐻1: 𝜎 = 10
3. 𝐻0: 𝑥 = 50, 𝐻1: 𝑥 ≠ 50
4. 𝐻0: 𝑝 = 0.1, 𝐻1: 𝑝 = 0.5
5. 𝐻0: 𝑠 = 30, 𝐻1: 𝑠 > 30

Solution:

1.𝐻0: 𝜇 = 25, 𝐻1: 𝜇 ≠ 25; This situation of hypothesis testing problem is correct because the thumb rule is that statement containing equality is the null hypothesis. In this situation we are finding whether the mean is equal to 25 or not.

2. 𝐻0: 𝜎 > 10, 𝐻1: 𝜎 = 10 ; This situation of hypothesis testing problem is wrong. Since we always state the null hypothesis with an equality claim.

3. 𝐻0: 𝑥 = 50, 𝐻1: 𝑥 ≠ 50 ; This situation of hypothesis testing problem is wrong. Since hypothesis are always statements for the population or distribution under study, not the statements about the sample.

4. 𝐻0: 𝑝 = 0.1, 𝐻1: 𝑝 = 0.5; This situation of hypothesis testing problem is wrong. since both the values of null and alternative hypothesis are different.

5. 𝐻0: 𝑠 = 30, 𝐻1: 𝑠 > 30; This situation of hypothesis testing problem is wrong. Since hypothesis are always statements for the population or distribution under study, not the statements about the sample.
Problem Statement 2:


The college bookstore tells prospective students that the average cost of its
textbooks is Rs. 52 with a standard deviation of Rs. 4.50. A group of smart statistics
students thinks that the average cost is higher. To test the bookstore’s claim against
their alternative, the students will select a random sample of size 100. Assume that
the mean from their random sample is Rs. 52.80. Perform a hypothesis test at the
5% level of significance and state your decision.
Solution:

𝐻0: 𝜇 <= 52
𝐻1: 𝜇 > 52

   
mean = 52
sample mean  = 52.80

z-test = ((52.80-52)/(4.50/100^0.5)) = 1.77

z value at 5% level of significance  = 1.64

z-test> z (at 5% level of significance)


z-test value lies in the critical region. So there is enough evidence to reject null hypothesis

i.e average cost of books is greater than 52







Problem Statement 3:


A certain chemical pollutant in the Genesee River has been constant for several
years with mean μ = 34 ppm (parts per million) and standard deviation σ = 8 ppm. A
group of factory representatives whose companies discharge liquids into the river is
now claiming that they have lowered the average with improved filtration devices. A
group of environmentalists will test to see if this is true at the 1% level of
significance. Assume \ that their sample of size 50 gives a mean of 32.5 ppm.
Perform a hypothesis test at the 1% level of significance and state your decision.
Solution:

𝐻0: 𝜇 = 34
𝐻1: 𝜇 < 34
    
   
mean = 34
Stddev = 8
n = 50
sample mean  = 32.5

z-test = ((32.5-34)/(8/50^0.5)) = -1.327

z value at 1% level of significance  = -2.33

z-test> z (at 1% level of significance)

the z-test value doesn't present in the critical region. So we accept the null hypothesis. This meand that companies claim of lowering the avrage chemical pollutant is wrong.

Problem Statement 4:


Based on population figures and other general information on the U.S. population,
suppose it has been estimated that, on average, a family of four in the U.S. spends
about $1135 annually on dental expenditures. Suppose further that a regional dental
association wants to test to determine if this figure is accurate for their area of
country. To test this, 22 families of 4 are randomly selected from the population in
that area of the country and a log is kept of the family’s dental expenditure for one
year. The resulting data are given below. Assuming, that dental expenditure is
normally distributed in the population, use the data and an alpha of 0.5 to test the
dental association’s hypothesis.
1008, 812, 1117, 1323, 1308, 1415, 831, 1021, 1287, 851, 930, 730, 699,
872, 913, 944, 954, 987, 1695, 995, 1003, 994
Solution:

𝐻0: 𝜇 = 1135
𝐻1: 𝜇  ≠ 1135
    
mean = 1135
S = 240.37
n = 22
sample mean  =  (1008+812+1117+1323+1308+1415+831+1021+1287+851+930+730+699+872+913+944+954+987+1695+995+1003+994)/22 = 1031.31

Since the populaulation std dev is not given and the sample size is less than 30, we use t-test


t = ((1031.31-1135)/(240.37/22^0.5)) = -2.02

since it is a two tailed test t value at = 2.080

t(0.025) = 2.080
t(-0.025)=-2.080

-2.080<-2.02<2.080

the t value doesn't fall under rejection region so we accept the null hypothesis.


Problem Statement 5:


In a report prepared by the Economic Research Department of a major bank the
Department manager maintains that the average annual family income on Metropolis is $48,432.What do you conclude about the validity of the report if a random sample of 400 families shows and average income of $48,574 with a standard deviation of 2000?
Solution:

𝐻0: 𝜇 = 48432
𝐻1: 𝜇  ≠ 48432

In this we are doing two tail test
mean = 48432
S = 2000
n = 400
sample mean = 48574

z = ((48574-48432)/(2000/400^0.5)) = 1.42

z value at 5% level of significance = (-1.96,1.96)

-1.96<1.42<1.96


calculated z value doesn't fall under rejection region. So we accept null hypothesis.

We can say that the report prepared by the Economic Research Department of a major bank on Department manager average annual family income on Metropolis is correct. (this statement is valid at 5% level of significance)
Problem Statement 6:


Suppose that in past years the average price per square foot for warehouses in the
United States has been $32.28. A national real estate investor wants to determine
whether that figure has changed now. The investor hires a researcher who randomly
samples 19 warehouses that are for sale across the United States and finds that the
mean price per square foot is $31.67, with a standard deviation of $1.29. assume
that the prices of warehouse footage are normally distributed in population. If the
researcher uses a 5% level of significance, what statistical conclusion can be
reached? What are the hypotheses?
Solution:


𝐻0: 𝜇 = 32.28
𝐻1: 𝜇  ≠ 32.28
    
    
population mean = 32.28
sample mean = 31.67
S = 1.29
sample size = 19
    
Since sample size is small, population variance is unknown and the sample is normally distributed, we will used t-test for this.


t-score(test)  = ((31.67-32.28)/(1.29/19^0.5)) = -2.103

critical t- value, for significance level 5% (two tailed) and degree of freedom = 19-1 = 18 


t(0.025) = 2.101     and t(-0.025) = -2.101

t (- 0.025) > t-score(test) 

So, the value lies in rejection region and we can reject our null hypothesis. Hence we can say that average price per square foot for warehouses has changed


Problem Statement 7:
Fill in the blank spaces in the table and draw your conclusions from it.



In this Problem Statement the standard deviation is not given to solve.
Problem Statement 8:

Find the t-score for a sample size of 16 taken from a population with mean 10 when
the sample mean is 12 and the sample standard deviation is 1.5.
 Solution:
 
 
 t-score = ((12-10)/(1.5/16^0.5)) = 5.33
Problem Statement 9:
    
Find the t-score below which we can expect 99% of sample means will fall if samples
of size 16 are taken from a normally distributed population.
Solution:

degree of freedom = 16-1 = 15
t-score = 2.602

Problem Statement 10:
    
If a random sample of size 25 drawn from a normal population gives a mean of 60
and a standard deviation of 4, find the range of t-scores where we can expect to find
the middle 95% of all sample means. Compute the probability that (−𝑡0.05 <𝑡<𝑡0.10).
Solution:


n = 25
sample mean = 60
sample std dev = 4

range of t-scores where we can expect to find the middle 95% of all sample means at df of 24 = (-2.064,2.064)

prob(−𝑡0.05 <𝑡<𝑡0.10) when df = 24

−𝑡0.05 leaves an area of 0.05 to the left and 𝑡0.10 leaves an area of 0.10 to the right. 

The total area between these two points is 1-0.05-0.10 = 0.85


probability that (−𝑡0.05 <𝑡<𝑡0.10) = 0.85
Problem Statement 11:
    
Two-tailed test for difference between two population means
Is there evidence to conclude that the number of people travelling from Bangalore to
Chennai is different from the number of people travelling from Bangalore to Hosur in
a week, given the following:
Population 1: Bangalore to Chennai n1 = 1200
x1 = 452
s1 = 212
Population 2: Bangalore to Hosur n2 = 800
x2 = 523
s2 = 185
Solution:


Let’s µ(1) and µ(2) be the mean people travelling from Bangalore to Chennai and Bangalore to Hosur
H0: µ(1) = µ(2)
H1: µ(1) is not equal to µ(2)
    
Assume level of significance  = 5%
    
Population 1: Bangalore to Chennai n1 = 1200
x1 = 452
s1 = 212
Population 2: Bangalore to Hosur n2 = 800
x2 = 523
s2 = 185


Standard error(SE) = [((S1)^2/n1 )+((S2)^2/n2)]^0.5 = 9.33
Z(test) = X1(mean)- X2(mean)/ (SE) = (452-523)/9.33 = -7.60



Since, it is a two tailed test, we need to find critical value for 2.5% on each tail.



Z(2.5%) = 1.96  and Z(-2.5%) = -1.96

Z(test)<Z(-2.5%); Z(test) falls in the critical region of Z(-2.5%). Thus we can reject null hypothesis.

By this we can conclude that the number of people travelling from Bangalore to Chennai is different from the number of people travelling from Bangalore to Hosur in a week.
Problem Statement 12:
    
    
Is there evidence to conclude that the number of people preferring Duracell battery is
different from the number of people preferring Energizer battery, given the following:

Population 1: Duracell

n1 = 100

x1 = 308

s1 = 84

Population 2: Energizer

n2 = 100

x2 = 254

s2 = 67
Solution:


Let’s µ(1) and µ(2) be the mean of people preferring Duracell battery and Energizer battery
H0: µ(1) = µ(2)
H1: µ(1) is not equal to µ(2)
    
Assume level of significance  = 5%
    
Population 1: Duracell

n1 = 100

x1 = 308

s1 = 84

Population 2: Energizer

n2 = 100

x2 = 254

s2 = 67


Standard error(SE) = [((S1)^2/n1 )+((S2)^2/n2)]^0.5 = 10.56
Z(test) = X1(mean)- X2(mean)/ (SE) = (308-254)/10.56 = 5.11



Since, it is a two tailed test, we need to find critical value for 2.5% on each tail.



Z(2.5%) = 1.96  and Z(-2.5%) = -1.96

Z(test)<Z(2.5%); Z(test) falls in the critical region of Z(2.5%). Thus we can reject null hypothesis.

By this we can conclude that the number of people preferring Duracell battery is different from the number of people preferring Energizer battery.
Problem Statement 13:
    
    
Pooled estimate of the population variance
Does the data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that average percentage
increase in the price of sugar differs when it is sold at two different prices?

Population 1: Price of sugar = Rs. 27.50

n1 = 14

x1 = 0.317%

s1 = 0.12%

Population 2: Price of sugar = Rs. 20.00 

n2 = 9
    
x2 = 0.21%

s2 = 0.11%
Solution:


Let’s µ(1) and µ(2) be the mean of price of sugar at place 1 and 2
H0: µ(1)-µ(2)=0
H1: µ(1)-µ(2)≠0  at α=0.05
    
Since the samples size is less than 30 we use t-test:
    
Standard error(SE) = [((S1)^2/n1 )+((S2)^2/n2)]^0.5 = 0.04
t(test) = x1- x2/0.04 = 0.317-0.21/0.04 = 2.675

critical value in the t-table for significance 5%(one tail test) at df of 21

t(0.05) = 1.721

We can see that, t(0.05) < t-score(test) = 2.675 > t (0.005)

So, the value lies in rejection region, so we can say that data provide sufficient evidence to conclude that average percentage
increase in the price of sugar differs when it is sold at two different prices
    

Problem Statement 14:
    
    
The manufacturers of compact disk players want to test whether a small price
reduction is enough to increase sales of their product. Is there evidence that the
small price reduction is enough to increase sales of compact disk players?

Population 1: Before reduction

n1 = 15

x1 = Rs. 6598

s1 = Rs. 844

Population 2: After reduction 

n2 = 12

x2 = RS. 6870

s2 = Rs. 669
Solution:


Let’s µ(1) and µ(2) be the mean of sales of compact disk players before and after price reducation

H0: µ(2)-µ(1)<=0
H1: µ(2)-µ(1)>0  at α=0.05
    
Since the samples size is less than 30 we use t-test:

    
Standard error(SE) = [((S1)^2/n1 )+((S2)^2/n2)]^0.5 = 296.994
t(test) = x2- x1/296.994 = 6870-6598/296.994 = 0.91

df = 15+12-2 = 25

critical value in the t-table for significance 5%(one tail test) at df of 25

t(0.05) = 1.708

We can see that, t(0.05) > t-score(test) = 1.708 > t-score(test)

So, the value lies in non-rejection region. Hence there is no enough evidence to reject null hypothesis. By this we can conclude that price reduction will not affect sales
Problem Statement 15:
    
Comparisons of two population proportions when the hypothesized difference is zero
Carry out a two-tailed test of the equality of banks’ share of the car loan market in
1980 and 1995.


Population 1: 1980
    
n1 = 100

x1 = 53

𝑝 1 = 0.53

Population 2: 1985
    
n2 = 100

x2 = 43

𝑝 2= 0.43
Solution:


let p1 and p2 be the  proportions of bank share of car loans in 1980 and 1985
H0: p1-p2 =0
H1: p1-p2 ≠0  at α=0.05
    
ˆp1−ˆp2=(53/100)-(43/100) = 0.53-0.43=0.1


pooled proportion ˆp= (x1+x2)/(n1+n2) = 53+43/100+100 = 0.48

SE = (ˆp(1−ˆp) * ((1/n1)+(1/n2)))^0.5 = 0.07065

z = ((ˆp1−ˆp2)/SE) = 0.1/0.07065 = 1.41


critical value in the z-table for significance 5%(two tail test)


z(-0.05) = -1.96
z(0.05) = 1.96
We can see that, z(-0.05)<z(test)<z(0.05), z(test) value doesn't fall under critical region. Hence there is no enough evidence to reject null hypothesis.


By this we can conclude that there is no significant difference between the bank share of car loans in 1980 and 1985. 


Problem Statement 16:
    
    
Carry out a one-tailed test to determine whether the population proportion of
traveler’s check buyers who buy at least $2500 in checks when sweepstakes prizes
are offered as at least 10% higher than the proportion of such buyers when no
sweepstakes are on.

Population 1: With sweepstakes
    
n1 = 300

x1 = 120

𝑝 = 0.40

Population 2: No sweepstakes 

n2 = 700

x2 = 140

𝑝 2= 0.20
Solution:


let p1 and p2 be the population proportion of traveler’s check buyers with sweepstakes and without sweepstakes

H0: p1-p2 <=0.10
H1: p1-p2 >0.10  at α=0.05

ˆp1−ˆp2=(120/300)-(140/700) = 0.4-0.2=0.2




SE =  0.031

z = ((ˆp1−ˆp2)-D/SE) = 0.2-0.1/0.031 = 3.22


critical value in the z-table for significance 5%(One tail test)


z(0.05) = 1.96
We can see that, z(test)>z(0.05), z(test) value fall under critical region. Hence there is enough evidence to reject null hypothesis.

28                                 22


H0: Dice is unbiased

H1: Dice is not unbiased


Chi statistics = (obesrved-expected)^2/expected = 9


degrees of freedon = 6-1 = 5, α=0.05

critical value = 12.592



Here, our chi statistic is less than the critical value. Thus, we will not reject the null hypothesis. Hence, we can say that dice is unbaised.

degrees of freedom = 4-1 = 3, α=0.05

Chi statistics =  19.87


    
   df = (2-1)*(2-1) = 1
   
   
  critical value = 3.841
  
 Here, our chi statistic is greater than the critical value. Thus, we will reject the null hypothesis. Therefore we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the "support" and "no support" conditions, in terms of the frequency with which individuals conformed.
    
    
Problem Statement 22:
    
    
We want to test whether short people differ with respect to their leadership qualities
(Genghis Khan, Adolf Hitler and Napoleon were all stature-deprived, and how many midget
MP's are there?) The following table shows the frequencies with which 43 short people and
52 tall people were categorized as "leaders", "followers" or as "unclassifiable". Is there a
relationship between height and leadership qualities?
[Chi-Square = 10.71, with 2 df: 𝑝 < 0.01].

Solution:


                           Short                   Tall        Total

H0: No relationship between height and leadership qualities 
    

H1: There is a relationship between height and leadership qualities

    
    
    Chi-Square  = 3.146 + 2.602 + 1.998 + 1.652 + 0.720 + 0.595 = 10.712
    
    df = (3-1)*(2-1) = 2
    
      critical value = 5.99
        
        
 Here, our chi statistic is greater than the critical value. Thus, we will reject the null hypothesis. Therefore we can conclude that there is a relationship between height and leadership qualities.
Problem Statement 23:
    
    
Each respondent in the Current Population Survey of March 1993 was classified as
employed, unemployed, or outside the labor force. The results for men in California age 35-
44 can be cross-tabulated by marital status, as follows:
    
Men of different marital status seem to have different distributions of labor force status. Or is
this just chance variation? (you may assume the table results from a simple random
sample.)
